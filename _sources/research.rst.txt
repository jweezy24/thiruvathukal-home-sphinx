Research/Collaborations
--------------------------

I derive significant energy from research collaborations, both within
and outside of my discipline, including both the humanities, sciences,
and engineering. These form the basis for many of my current research
projects and scholarly pursuits:

Disciplinary Interactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Yung-Hsiang
Lu <https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/People/ptProfile?resource_id=3355>`__
(Purdue University) and I collaborate on **systems software to support
computer vision at scale**. I am involved as co-PI and lead of
**software engineering** in the `Purdue
HELPS <https://www.purduehelps.org/>`__ research group with specific
focus on the `CAM2 Project <https://www.cam2project.net/>`__.

`Venkat
Vishwanath <https://www.alcf.anl.gov/staff-directory/venkatram-vishwanath>`__,
`Silvio Rizzi <https://www.alcf.anl.gov/staff-directory/silvio-rizzi>`__
and `Xiaoyong
Jin <https://www.alcf.anl.gov/staff-directory/xiao-yong-jin>`__ (Argone
National Laboratory), `François
Tessier <http://www.francoistessier.info/>`__ (ETH Zurich/CSCS),
`Cameron Christensen <https://www.sci.utah.edu/people/cam.html>`__ (SCI
at University of Utah) and I collaborate on emerging runtimes for data
science and engineering, focused on bringing **cloud computing
frameworks to supercomputers**. Silvio Rizzi, `Dario
Dematties <https://github.com/dariodematties>`__ (PhD Student,
University of Buenos Aires), and I are collaborating on
**biologically-inspired models of machine learning and artificial
intelligence**.

`Jeffrey C. Carver <http://carver.cs.ua.edu/>`__ (University of
Alabama), `Nasir O. Eisty <https://neisty.github.io/>`__ (PhD Student at
University of Alabama) and I collaborate on **empirical software
engineering**, specifically to understand and encourage best practices
in scientific and research sofware development, including the
`SE4Science <https://se4science.org/>`__ initiative. Our focus is on the
use of **software metrics** in research software development.

`Konstantin Läufer <http://laufer.cs.luc.edu/>`__, `Nick
Hayward <https://www.luc.edu/cs/people/ftfaculty/haywardnicholas.shtml>`__,
and I (all at Loyola University Chicago) collaborate on **tools for
software engineering** and **mining software repositories** using an
emerging `Metrics Dashboard <http://luc-metrics.herokuapp.com/>`__.

`Ronald I. Greenberg <https://rig.cs.luc.edu/~rig/>`__ and I collaborate
in **computing education research**, focused on **robotics** at middle
and high school levels.

Interdisciplinary Interactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In 2012, Steve E. Jones and I wrote a book about the Nintendo Wii in the
`MIT Press <https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/codename-revolution>`__.

`David B.
Dennis <https://www.luc.edu/history/people/facultyandstaffdirectory/facultybytheme/politics/dennisdavidb.shtml>`__
(cultural historian at Loyola University Chicago as well) and I are
working on a new **cutural history of computing** textbook for Taylor
and Francis/CRC Press and **scholarly notetaking tools** via the
`ZettelGeist <https://zettelgeist.com/>`__ project.

`Gregory J. Matthews <https://statsinthewild.com/>`__, `Juliet K.
Brophy <https://lsu.edu/ga/people/faculty/juliet-k-brophy/index.php>`__
, and `Ofer Harel <https://stat.uconn.edu/ofer-harel/>`__ and I are
collaborating the use of **statistical methods, machine learning, and
crowdsourcing for shape analysis**, with a specific application to
understanding the fossil record.

`David B. Wetzel <http://davidbrookewetzel.net/>`__, `Griffin
Moe <http://griffinmoe.com/>`__, and I are collaborating on **electronic
and digital music** software for accessible ensemble performance, which
we use to run the `Loyola University Technology
Ensemble <https://lute.luc.edu/>`__. Come and join us sometime!
